    "Este proyecto se propone desarrollar un asistente de inteligencia artificial integrado en una plataforma de traveltech, que facilita la elección personalizada de hoteles y destinos para los usuarios. Utilizando la función \"knowledge base\" de Amazon Bedrock, el sistema integrará una extensa base de datos con información detallada sobre más de 2 millones de hoteles. Para este efecto  \n",
    "\n",
    "El objetivo principal de este proyecto es transformar la experiencia de planificación de viajes, haciendo que sea más intuitiva, personalizada y respaldada por datos. Las metas específicas incluyen mejorar la satisfacción del cliente mediante recomendaciones precisas y personalizadas, reducir el tiempo necesario para planificar un viaje y aumentar la eficiencia del proceso de selección de destinos y hoteles.\n",
    "\n",
    "El asistente empleará modelos avanzados de sistemas de recomendación, potenciados por un modelo de lenguaje de aprendizaje profundo (LLM), para sugerir itinerarios personalizados y ofrecer asistencia general en la planificación de viajes. Las recomendaciones incluirán referencias detalladas a los hoteles disponibles en nuestra base de datos, asegurando que los usuarios reciban opciones que no solo se ajustan a sus preferencias personales, sino que también maximizan la calidad y la relevancia de la información proporcionada."
